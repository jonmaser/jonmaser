			.about-me-header 
				I always seek adventure.
			.about-me-subtitle
				I fuck up a lot, and sometimes succeed too; but it's always the journey that's worthwhile.
			.about-me-mission-text
				“Adventure” is so overused, so let me clarify...I thrive most when there are no plans, the unexpected is expected and “new” describes everyone you meet, everywhere you go and the situations you experience.
				<br>
				<br>
				In business, it’s those who are comfortable deviating from the norm that will succeed and in travel, it’s those who go outside of their comfort zone that will have the most authentic experiences.
				<br>
				<br>
				Whether through launching travel tech companies, riding across countries on motorcycles, learning to code or circumnaviating the world on a ship, I'm constantly striving towards unfamiliar people, places and experiences.

					What I strongly believe
				.traveler-quote-name
					Travel can be used as a force for good.
				.traveler-quote-text
					In addition to being the world's largest wealth distribution mechanism, travel can widen perspectives, evoke empathy and bring our world closer together. Travel has not only exposed the beauty and excitement in life but also, how unaware many are about one another. Because of that, I’ve dedicated my life helping others experience our world in a meaningful and positive way.

						A for-profit social enterprise, MadebyAdventure was founded in order to use travel as a force for good. Our team has partnered with non-profits, media outlets, ambassadors and travelers around the world to collaborate on trips that not only make a positive impact economically but also to minimize the environmental footprint and promote empathy through local guides and experiences. Our 2016 trips include Kyrgyzstan, Peru, Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico and Panama. A consulting branch was also established to assist our local partners on an on-going basis post-trip.

						Connecting local adventure guides with travelers
					.brand-grid-description
						I founded Adventure Local (Advlo) in 2013 after circumnavigating the globe, meeting countless amazing local guides and realize all of my best experiences stemmed from authentic connections that couldn’t be found online.
